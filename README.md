Tell your stories

1. Core Concept
A collaborative storytelling platform where people submit their first-hand knowledge or
perspectives on a topic (e.g., history of crypto). An AI “editor” ingests these snippets and
weaves them into a coherent narrative. Instead of having one author, the story is co-authored by
all participants. Each participant stakes a deposit alongside their contribution, creating a unique
incentive structure.
---
2. User Flow
1. Choose or Create a Topic
Anyone can propose a topic—such as “History of Crypto,
” “Local Folk Stories,
” “Untold Stories
of Environmental Activism,
” etc.
Proposed topics can be open for a period (e.g., 6 months) to gather contributions.
2. Contribute Knowledge
Users write a piece of their story: a perspective, a historical fact, a personal anecdote, or even a
data-driven analysis.
The contribution is then uploaded to the platform, either as text, images, or other permissible
media formats (if desired).
3. Stake Deposits
Alongside the knowledge, each contributor deposits a stablecoin (say, USDC) into a smart
contract.
In return, the user receives a platform-native “contributor token” (1:1 with the stable amount).
This token proves their stake in the topic.
4. AI Aggregation
Contributions are continuously analyzed by the AI agent.
The AI uses summarization and narrative-building algorithms to create a continuously updated
“living novel” around the topic.
Readers can see the story in a linear, human-readable form, but also drill down into specific
contributions or sources.
5. Yield Distribution
The stablecoin deposits collectively generate yield (for example, by being lent in a decentralized
lending protocol).
That yield is distributed to all contributors proportionally to their stake or tokens held.
6. Token Redemption or Sale
Contributors can do one of three things with their “contributor tokens”:
1. Sell them (forfeiting their stable deposit but monetizing the token).
2. Redeem them (claim their stable deposit back, but then lose the “contributor tokens”).
3. Keep both (maintain stable deposit locked and hold contributor tokens to continue earning
yield).
After 6 months, the stable can no longer be redeemed, but token holders keep receiving yield
from the capital pool.

3. Incentive Mechanisms
1. Quality Over Quantity
Because contributors must stake a deposit, there’s a natural incentive to contribute meaningful
information. Low-effort or spam entries are disincentivized.
Additionally, the platform might implement a peer-review or community “voting” feature, where
higher-quality contributions are surfaced more prominently in the AI-aggregated narrative.
2. Shared Yield
The yield from the stablecoin deposits forms a pool that rewards all contributors.
The more compelling the topic and the more participants, the larger the potential yield.
This structure may encourage broader or deeper contributions, as it becomes more attractive to
“stake” knowledge on popular or emerging topics.
3. Long-Term Commitment
The 6-month redemption window forces contributors to think long-term.
If they believe the topic will attract a lot of attention, they might keep tokens and deposits to earn
yield. Otherwise, they can exit early at the cost of losing future yield.

4. The AI Component
1. Automated Editing & Summarization
The AI uses Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to read through each contribution and
identify major themes, events, and perspectives.
It compiles these into a cohesive narrative that updates over time.
Readers can toggle between a high-level “storyline” and a more granular or technical view with
detailed sources.
2. Managing Contradictory Information
In historical or subjective topics, different users may have conflicting accounts.
The AI can highlight points of conflict, prompt contributors for additional clarifications, or
propose multiple versions (e.g.,
“Some contributors say X, while others say Y”).
This preserves conflicting viewpoints rather than forcing a single “canonical” version.
3. Contextual Relevance
The AI might also use a rating system that weighs contributions by quality signals (e.g., upvotes,
references, user reputation, or external verification).
More reliable or well-sourced contributions get more weight in the final narrative.
---
5. Governance & Moderation
1. DAO-Style Governance
The platform could be governed by a DAO comprising all “contributor token” holders across all
topics.
Proposals about improvements (e.g., how yield is allocated, which AI model to use, which DeFi
protocol to stake in) can be voted on by token holders.
2. Moderation & Dispute Resolution
Community moderators or an automated detection system (for spam, offensive content, etc.)
ensure the platform doesn’t devolve into chaos.
Disputes about fraudulent or harmful content might be resolved via a combination of AI flags
and human oversight.
3. Topic Curation
Not all topics may attract significant interest. Some will be highly popular (like History of Crypto),
others will remain small.
A curation mechanism can highlight trending or significant stories, directing new potential
contributors to topics with high demand for additional info.

6. Potential Challenges and Considerations
1. Onboarding & User Education
For non-crypto-savvy users, the concept of depositing stablecoins, receiving tokens, and
earning yield may be daunting.
A user-friendly front-end is crucial: integrate with popular wallets or custodial solutions and walk
novices through the process.
2. Legal and Regulatory Aspects
Yield-generating stablecoins in some jurisdictions could be subject to financial regulations.
Might require disclaimers, compliance checks, or geofencing.
3. Fair Distribution of AI Attention
If a small group contributes an overwhelming amount of content, do they dominate the
narrative?
The AI must balance coverage so that all perspectives are represented proportionally, or at least
fairly.
4. Sustaining Momentum
A novel topic will generate attention at first, but how do we ensure ongoing contributions?
Perhaps have “chapters” or phases that open/close periodically, with rewards for contributors
who provide final or summary contributions near chapter endings.
5. Maintaining Objectivity or Transparency
Given that it’s a communal story, the AI needs to show how it arrived at certain conclusions or
summaries.
Include version histories, references, and a “source list” that link back to original contributions.
---
7. Possible Extensions
1. NFT Layer for Credibility
Each contributor’s piece could be minted as an NFT to certify their authorship and maintain a
permanent record of their contribution on-chain.
Future readers can see exactly who contributed which piece.
2. Gamification & Reputation
Implement a reputation system that ranks contributors based on peer feedback, references, or
the “impact” of their content on the final narrative.
High-reputation contributors might earn additional platform privileges or a larger share of yield.
3. Cross-Topic Linking
Knowledge from one topic (e.g., Early Bitcoin Mining) could be relevant to another topic (e.g.,
Satoshi’s Mythology).
AI can cross-reference or link these stories, creating a broader network or “storyverse.
”
4. Publishing Options
Once a topic’s story reaches a certain maturity, the community can vote to “freeze” a version
and publish it as an eBook or interactive web experience.
The yield from sales or attention on that published piece could flow back into the contributor
yield pool.
5. Collaborations With Existing Communities
Partnerships with historical societies, research institutions, or universities.
For instance, a research group might co-sponsor a topic and help validate or structure the data,
bringing credibility and new contributors.

8. Summing It Up
Goal: Create a living, crowd-sourced “novel” (or historical narrative) around a topic, powered by
user contributions and AI summarization.
Monetization & Incentives: Contributors stake stablecoins to ensure commitment and quality;
yields from those stables get distributed to contributors.
Token Dynamics: Contributors receive a 1:1 token for their deposit, giving them future yield or
redemption options, ensuring a healthy balance of liquidity and long-term engagement.
Governance: Potentially DAO-driven, with community input on big-picture decisions like AI
protocols, yield strategies, and curation policies.
By weaving these elements together, the platform becomes a unique blend of collaborative
storytelling, decentralized finance, and AI-driven content curation. It incentivizes high-quality,
truthful contributions by leveraging the natural synergy between content and capital in a novel
way
